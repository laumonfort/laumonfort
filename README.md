# 💫 About Me:

✨ I'm a software developer who loves collaborative culture. Graduated in Multiplatform Application Development, I enjoy sharing knowledge in developer communities.🍏 Swift is my first language. Although I'm always open to explore new technologies to obtain better results. I love learning about UX and various areas to complement my knowledge. As for me, I'm an Open-source contributor who enjoys nature, cultural activities, and chocolate.

🔭 In formal terms, my university studies and ten years of work experience in digital marketing and the communications field, helped me identify and anticipate customer needs, and have attention to detail.

📲 I believe software development can improve the quality of life. That's why I'm currently working on a collaborative project for a non-profit association. 🌱 Oriented to help people improve their lives through technology, I realize the importance of clean code that facilitates teamwork.<br><br>📫 How to reach me: l.monfortgomez@gmail, https://www.linkedin.com/in/lmonfort/
