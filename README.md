### Hi there! 👋  

![GithubReadMeiOSDevLaura]

👩🏻‍💻 I'm a Software Developer who graduated in Multiplatform Application Development (DAM) from Stucom (Barcelona).

In addition, I have college studies and ten years of work experience in the digital marketing and communications field, a sector in which I developed some of my most outstanding skills, such as identifying and anticipating clients' needs, being a teamwork player, and results-driven oriented person.

📲 I believe in software development as a mode to improve the quality of life. I am interested in the creation of carefully crafted technological products.  That's why I’m currently working on a collaborative project for a non-profit association.

Consequently, for the last few years, I have been learning programming languages and user experience (UX) while continuing to learn in various areas that have given me a responsible and socially committed vision.

🎯 My goal is to develop my professional career in software development to achieve the best possible results. To do this, I  take a creative look at any technical challenge. 

I am oriented to help people improve their lives through technology. In order to achieve it, I also realise the importance of a clean code that facilitates teamwork.
